# ReactJS & Python CRUD Application

## What I Learned from This Project

### 1. Full-Stack Development with React & Python
- Improved my skills in integrating React.js with a Python backend.
- Structured a React application effectively and managed state efficiently using React hooks.

### 2. Working with SQL Databases
- Gained experience in storing and retrieving data from an SQL server instead of relying solely on JSON data.
- Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for data persistence.

### 3. Data Visualization with Charts
- Worked with charting libraries like Recharts.js to display line and bar charts.
- Created multi-axis charts to represent different data metrics dynamically.

### 4. Optimizing Performance
- Used pagination and efficient data-fetching techniques to improve frontend performance.
- Optimized SQL queries to ensure smooth data retrieval and minimize response time.

### 5. Deployment & Cloud Hosting
- Learned how to deploy full-stack applications on platforms like Render/PythonAnywhere.
- Gained hands-on experience with hosting backend services and connecting them to the frontend.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Setting Up SQL Integration
- Faced difficulties configuring the database and handling migrations properly.
- Resolved this by carefully defining my database schema and using an ORM like SQLAlchemy/Django ORM.

### 2. Making the Table Rows Editable
- Handling inline edits while maintaining state synchronization was tricky.
- Overcame this by implementing controlled components and updating the backend efficiently on each edit.

### 3. Chart Implementation Complexity
- Creating a multi-axis chart with dynamic filtering required extra effort.
- Learned how to properly structure the dataset and use dropdowns to filter chart data dynamically.

### 4. Deployment Issues
- Deploying the backend and frontend together with proper CORS handling required debugging.
- Resolved issues by configuring the server correctly and using environment variables for API URLs.
